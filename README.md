# Assignment 5: Loop Mastery

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates mastery of while loops, for loops, and nested loops.

## Challenge 1: Collatz Sequence
- **Loop used:** while
- **Reasoning:** The number of iterations is unknown.
- **Algorithm:** 
  1. Start with a positive integer n
  2. If n is even, divide by 2; if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
  3. Repeat until n equals 1
- **Output:** Sequence of numbers and step count

## Challenge 2: Prime Number Checker
- **Loop used:** for
- **Reasoning:** The number of iterations (2 to n-1) is known.
- **Algorithm:**
  1. Test divisibility of n by each number from 2 to n-1
  2. If divisible, n is not prime; else, n is prime
- **Output:** Whether the number is prime and its divisors (if any)

## Challenge 3: Multiplication Table Grid
- **Loop used:** nested loops
- **Reasoning:** Outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns
- **Algorithm:**
  1. Print header row (1-10)
  2. For each row, calculate products with each column
  3. Align output in a table format
- **Output:** Formatted 10x10 multiplication table
